# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains code and resources for Credit Card Fraud Detection.

## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a prevalent issue in today's digital transactions. This project aims to develop machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, thus minimizing financial losses for both consumers and financial institutions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Credit card Fraud detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection).

## Setup Instructions

To run the project code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/surya-579/Credit-card-Fraud-Detection.git
    ```
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
3. Install the required Python libraries.
4. Open and run the `Credit_Card_Fraud_detection.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Results

The project evaluates the performance of various machine learning algorithms for detecting credit card fraud. The evaluation metrics used include accuracy_score, classification_report. Insights into feature importance are also provided.

## Conclusion

By accurately detecting credit card fraud, financial institutions can prevent financial losses and maintain customer trust. This project serves as a demonstration of building and comparing predictive models for credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques.
